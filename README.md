# Cat-Pal 🐱✔️  
*A cozy Electron + React task manager with a tiny cat companion*

**Cat-Pal** is a lightweight desktop app that helps you organize your tasks while you’re using your PC.  
Create tasks across categories, mark them as **To Do**, **In Progress**, or **Done**, and stay productive —  
all while a cute cat chills at the bottom of your screen.

Need a break? Switch to the **Cat** tab to **feed**, **pet**, or **play** with your virtual buddy.  
Get things done — without killing the vibe. 💖
